About this site
---------------

This is the code behind: http://yulfy.com or http://yulfy.eu.  The site is powered by React and follows Airbnb's style guidelines.  The main purpose in opening the site's code out to the public is to enforce stricter guidelines on myself (as I don't want to publish crap code) as well as acting as an example or template to others who want to create their own personal React site.  

Contributing
------------

If you notice a bug or just want to add a cool feature I suggest you clone the repository as well as Airbnb's eslint style guidelines.  You can then submit a pull request with any changes you see fit.  I'll likely get around to pull requests within 24 hours.
